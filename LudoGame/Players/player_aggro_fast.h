//*     Strategy of 'player_aggro_fast'                                                 *
//*     If possible send an opponent home, if multiple options, goes for maximum damage *
//*     Else brings pieces into goal and into play when possible,                       *
//*     but else it will push the front most piece around the outfield,                 *
//*     while making sure it only sends its own pieces home when forced to do so.       *
//*     In 2-vs-2 play agains player_random      it wins approx. 92% of the time        *
//*     In 2-vs-2 play agains player_random_safe it wins approx. 89% of the time        *
//*     In 2-vs-2 play agains player_fast        it wins approx. 70% of the time        *
